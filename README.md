# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I took CS65 so I learned Android programming, but I have an iPhone so I have always wanted to learn iOS programming. I followed two tutorials, one that dealt more with Swift programming, where I built an app that shows cool travel destinations around the world. It even includes a scrollable map with clickable locations! I also wanted to learn more about Storyboards, so I followed a tutorial that showed how to make a copy of a facebook page UI.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

N/A, I worked alone.

## What you learned

I learned a lot about how to build and design iOS apps. I learned some of the syntax of the Swift programming language including building custom data structures. I also worked a lot with front-end and realized it was not my favorite. I enjoyed working on the backend with Swift way more. Working with storyboards was way more challenging than I expected.

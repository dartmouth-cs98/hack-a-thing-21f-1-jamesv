# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I took CS65 so I learned Android programming, but I have an iPhone so I have always wanted to learn iOS programming. I followed two tutorials, one that dealt more with Swift programming, where I built an app that shows cool travel destinations around the world. It even includes a scrollable map with clickable locations! After clicking the locations, it brings up travel information about it.

I then tried building a tasks app off of another tutorial, but quit after not being able to solve a bug. The app allows you to create a list of tasks and then add to it. However, I also had a hard time working with Storyboards so I decided to try a third tutorial that focused on them.

I then wanted to learn more about Storyboards, so I followed a tutorial that showed how to make a copy of a facebook page UI.


## Who Did What?

N/A, I worked alone.

## What you learned

I learned a lot about how to build and design iOS apps. I learned some of the syntax of the Swift programming language including building custom data structures. I also worked a lot with front-end and realized it was not my favorite. I enjoyed working on the backend with Swift way more. Working with storyboards was way more challenging than I expected.

I found out that I like android programming more than iOS. Maybe it is just because I have more experience, but I find working with Java within Android Studio to be better than Swift within XCode. However, I am proud of the two apps I was able to successfully build in such a short period of time!

## What didn't work

I followed the tutorials pretty closely. I was using a different version of xcode as them so some things had different names. For example, it took me a while how to replicate Single-View Apps that were an option in XCode 11, but not XCode 12. I got the locations app fully working. As previously mentioned, I could not solve a bug I was getting in the task app. For the storyboard tutorial, I couldn't get the two gray lines that are used as dividers to show up when I run the simulator.
